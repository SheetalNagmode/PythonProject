#Conditional statements: if...else and elif
#Syntax :
#if condition:
#   statements
#else:
#   statements
# indentation before the statements is very important and must
# No semicolon or comma needed at the end of statement.
# Colon at the end of if and else is needed.
# Multiple statements can be added for both.
# Either condition can be added after if or else or boolean values can be used(True, False)
# Comma is used inside the statement if needed to append any value.
# In python True= 1 and False= 0.
# Instead of true or false 1 or 0 can be used respectively

# Example 1:

a=50
if a>30:
    print("This is a true condition")
else:
    print("This is a false condition")

# Example 2:

if False:
    print('This is a true condition')
else:
    print('This is a false condition')

#Example 3:
if 0:
    print('This is a true condition')
else:
    print('This is a false condition')
