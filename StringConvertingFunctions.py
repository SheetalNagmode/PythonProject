# title() = Every word in the sentence will start with capital letter
# lower() = All the characters in the string will be converted to lowercase
# upper() = All the characters in the string will be converted to uppercase
# swapcase() = will convert upper into lower case and vice versa
# replace("","") = replace single or multiple characters in a string with suggested new characters

print(s1)

s2 = s.title()
print(s2)

s3 = s.lower()
print(s3)
